The founders of FiveOceans give ocean rubbish a new life, using plastic collected from the Indian Ocean, proving it is possible to close the cycle with ocean waste and high quality surf gear.In this stunning documentary, they prove their mission and reveal a transparent value chain of the waste material to design a performance product for surfers. With their background in engineering, the unrivalled story is underlined by surfing, adventure and great personalities as the two friends battle their way to achieve a much higher goal: reducing the plastic that ends up in the oceans they surf.</desc>
